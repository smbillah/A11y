- title: "DarkReader: Bridging the Gap Between Perception andReality of Power Consumption in Smartphonesfor Blind Users (to appear)"
  image: darkreader.png
  description: "DarkReader is a screen reader developed in Android that bridges blind users' perception of power consumption to reality. DarkReader darkens the screen by <b>truly</b> turning it off, but allows users to interact with their smartphones. A user study with 10 blind participants shows that DarkReader saves 24% to 52% power depending on tasks and screen brightness."

- title: "Accessible Gesture Typing for NonVisual Text Entry on Smartphones"
  image: AGTex.png
  description: "Gesture typing is a fast text-entry technique for sighted users which is commonly known as entering a word by gliding the finger sequentially over letter to letter. However, this input paradigm is currently inaccessible to blind users because it is difficult to draw shape gestures on a virtual keyboard without access to key visuals. This paper describes the design of accessible gesture typing, to bring this input paradigm to blind users."

- title: "Towards Enabling Blind People to Independently Write on Printed Forms"
  image: wiyg.png
  description: "Filling out printed forms (e.g., checks) independently is currently impossible for blind people, since they cannot pinpoint the locations of the form fields, and quite often, they cannot even figure out what fields (e.g., name) are present in the form. Hence, they always depend on sighted people to write on their behalf, and help them affix their signatures. In this paper, we introduce WiYG, a Write-it-Yourself guide that directs a blind user to the different form fields, so that she can independently fill out these fields without seeking assistance from a sighted person."

  image: dummy.png
  description: "Web browsing has never been easy for blind people, primarily due to the serial press-and-listen interaction mode of screen readers. Auto-suggesting the next browsing action has the potential to assist blind users in swiftly completing various tasks with minimal effort. In this paper, we present generalize SuggestOmatic, a personalized and scalable unsupervised approach for predicting the most likely next browsing action of the user, and proactively suggesting it to the user so that the user can avoid pressing a lot of shortcuts to complete that action."

  image: steeringWheel.png
  description: "SteeringWheel is a locality-preserving screen magnifier that retains contextually meaningful information in the magnifier's current viewport. While magnifying, unlike regular screen magnifiers, SteeringWheel discriminates between whitespace and non-whitespace within a page to preserve locality. Brute-force panning in the magnified view is addressed by limiting the focus of magnification at any time to a single logical segment, and restricting the cursor movement to the boundaries of this segment. Also, SteeringWheel utilizes 1-D rotational gestures to facilitate seamless customization and personalization."
