## Open Ph.D. / Postdoc Positions
We are looking for  Ph.D. students and Postdoc. 

<div style="text-align: justify">
Our goal is to endow assistive technologies with the capacity to substitute, recover, empower, or augment human's physical, sensorial or cognitive capabilities. Towards that, candidates will work on cutting-edge technologies, such as personalized 3D fabrication, smart textile, augmented reality, human-AI interaction, invisible UI, and IoT.
 
The ideal candidate should have a strong technical background, as well as experience with coursework/research in one or more of the following areas: HCI, AI, Accessibility, and Systems. Prior experience working with *human subjects* is not required but will be considered a plus.  Ph.D. students will have the opportunity to generate their own research agenda. Preference will be given to students who already have a masters degree from the USA. 

If you are interested, please email me at *skb5969+phd@psu.edu*. State briefly why you are interested, and attach a CV. **Important**: please insert _"PhD/Postdoc Position"_ in the subject line.
