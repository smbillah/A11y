## Open Ph.D. Positions
We are looking for  Ph.D. students. 

<div style="text-align: justify">
Our goal is to endow assistive technologies with the capacity to substitute, recover, empower, or augment human's physical, sensorial, or cognitive capabilities. Towards that, candidates will work on cutting-edge technologies, including but not limited to smart input/output techniques, personalized 3D fabrication, smart textile, augmented reality, human-AI interaction, invisible UI, and assisted living.

The ideal candidate should have a strong technical background in CS/EE/ME, as well as experience with coursework/research in one or more of the following areas: HCI, AI, Accessibility, and Systems. Prior experience working with human subjects is not required but will be considered a plus. Ph.D. students will have the opportunity to generate their own research agenda. Preference will be given to students who already have a master's degree from the USA.

If you are interested, please email me at *sbillah@psu.edu*. State briefly why you are interested, and attach a CV. **Important**: please insert _"PhD Position"_ in the subject line.
